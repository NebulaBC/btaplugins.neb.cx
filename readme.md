BTA plugins server.
----------

The bta plugins server is a small semi-official release of 1.7.6 for serversides only.  
it adds support for plugins (*just like it sounds*), if you are not experienced with server plugins, think Bukkit but for BTA.

The development kit is at: https://github.com/NebulaBC/bta_example_plugin  
You can download the server.jar from: https://github.com/NebulaBC/bta_example_plugin/raw/master/libs/bta-server.jar

If something you want to do is not possible, let me know and I can add endpoints!  
For help with setting up the plugin environment or if you run into any issues send me a message: NebulaBC#7706
