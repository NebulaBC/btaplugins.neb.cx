BTA plugins server.
----------

The bta plugins server is a small release of 1.7.6 for serversides only.  
it adds support for plugins (*just like it sounds*), if you are not experienced with server plugins, think Bukkit but for BTA.

The development kit is at: [https://github.com/NebulaBC/bta_example_plugin](https://github.com/NebulaBC/bta_example_plugin)  
You can download the server.jar from: [https://github.com/NebulaBC/bta_example_plugin/raw/master/libs/bta-server.jar](https://github.com/NebulaBC/bta_example_plugin/raw/master/libs/bta-server.jar)

If something you want to do is not yet possible, let me know and I can add endpoints!  
For help with setting up the plugin environment or if you run into any issues create a help request on the Discord.

Existing plugins:  
[Greeter](https://github.com/NebulaBC/greeter/) - Welcomes new players to your server.  
[Ranks](https://github.com/NebulaBC/ranks) - Create ranks with custom chat prefixes!  
[WorldEdit](https://github.com/azurelmao/WorldEdit) - WorldEdit for BTA.
